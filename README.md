# Secure-Programming-Final

This is my Secure Programming final. Unfortunately I don't know how to build this project as a JAR executable since it has a MySQL driver involved. At the time of submission and presentation, my group and I relied on the Netbeans IDE to run it as configured.

This was a group project, I will duplicate Java files that are entirely my own in the root folder. Some of the GUI Java files that have MySQL statements in them are where I was involved.

I was responsible for writing secure MySQL statements that were not exploitable and for creating the MySQL database for user authentication and user payroll information. The rest of the group focused on the concept and building of the GUI and control flow.

Also, there is a Java file or two where the root password to the database is stored, yes this is terrible... I promise I would never leave that in source!

Original Submission notes to professor:
---
"Here is the final payroll app with last minute touches. The project folder is a Netbeans project so you can use the IDE to get setup. I packaged in the driver I used incase there's any inconsistencies. The database connection uses the root account with the username "root", and password "sesame123". The SQL script will setup the schema required to interface with the application."
